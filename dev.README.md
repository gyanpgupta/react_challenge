## What I have done :

- Integrated api using fetch ().
- I have used redux state to store data.
- Render svg Data on App Component.
- when we hover on particular svg it show a hex color code instead of svg.
- When we reload or refresh the page the svg sequence change randomly.
- I have wrote unit test cases for apiMiddleware,rootReducer and app.js component.


- Unit Test cases for apiMiddleware and rootReducer are passing.

=> I tried to write test cases for App.js file. But they are failing.
